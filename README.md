Case 11.3
Does “Pepsi Stuff” Include a Harrier Jet?
Leonard v PepsiCo
210 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 2000)
Facts
PepsiCo (defendant/appellee) ran a promotion titled “Pepsi Stuff,” which encouraged consumers to collect Pepsi Points from specially marked packages of Pepsi or Diet Pepsi and redeem these points for merchandise featuring the Pepsi logo. John Leonard (plaintiff/appellant) saw the Pepsi Stuff commercial featuring the Harrier Jet as an example of “stuff.” The ad shows a teenager in awe of the jet and the subtitles on the screen are descriptions of what the teen sees: “T-SHIRT 75 PEPSI POINTS,” “LEATHER JACKET 1450 PEPSI POINTS,” and “SHADES 175 PEPSI POINTS.” A voiceover then intones, “Introducing the new Pepsi Stuff catalog,” as the camera focuses on the cover of the catalog.
Following these lesser items, a Harrier jet swings into view and lands by the side of the teen’s school building, next to a bicycle rack. The cockpit opens and the teen, inside the cockpit of the Harrier jet, holding a Pepsi exclaims, “Sure beats the bus!” A military drumroll sounds as the following words appear: “HARRIER FIGHTER 7,000,000 PEPSI POINTS.” A few seconds later, the following appears in more stylized script: “Drink Pepsi—Get Stuff.”
Inspired by this commercial, Mr. Leonard set out to obtain a Harrier jet. The catalog notes that in the event that a consumer lacks enough Pepsi Points to obtain a desired item, additional Pepsi Points may be purchased for 10 cents each; however, at least 15 original Pepsi Points must accompany each order.
Mr. Leonard could not collect 7,000,000 Pepsi Points by consuming Pepsi products fast enough, so through acquaintances, Mr. Leonard raised about $700,000. On March 27, 1996, Mr. Leonard submitted an order form, 15 original Pepsi Points, and a check for $700,008.50. At the bottom of the order form, Mr. Leonard wrote in “Harrier Jet” in the “Item” column and “7,000,000” in the “Total Points” column. In a letter accompanying his submission, Mr. Leonard stated that the check was to purchase additional Pepsi Points “expressly for obtaining a new Harrier jet as advertised in your Pepsi Stuff commercial.” On May 7, 1996, PepsiCo rejected Mr. Leonard’s submission and returned the check, explaining,
The item that you have requested is not part of the Pepsi Stuff collection. It is not included in the catalogue or on the order form, and only catalogue merchandise can be redeemed under this program.
The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial is fanciful and is simply included to create a humorous and entertaining ad. We apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that you may have experienced and are enclosing some free product coupons for your use.
Mr. Leonard responded via his lawyer:
Your letter of May 7, 1996 is totally unacceptable. We have reviewed the video tape of the Pepsi Stuff commercial … and it clearly offers the new Harrier jet for 7,000,000 Pepsi Points. Our client followed your rules explicitly …
This is a formal demand that you honor your commitment and make immediate arrangements to transfer the new Harrier jet to our client. If we do not receive transfer instructions within ten (10) business days of the date of this letter, you will leave us no choice but to file an appropriate action against Pepsi …
Mr. Leonard filed suit, and PepsiCo moved for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment, and Mr. Leonard appealed.
Judicial Opinion
WOOD, District Judge
PER CURIAM
We affirm for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Wood’s opinion. See 88 F. Supp. 2d 116 (S.D.N.Y.1999). [To help you understand the issues in the case, portions of Judge Wood’s opinion follow.]
The general rule is that an advertisement does not constitute an offer.
An advertisement is not transformed into an enforceable offer merely by a potential offeree’s expression of willingness to accept the offer through, among other means, completion of an order form.
Under these principles, plaintiff’s letter of March 27, 1996, with the Order Form and the appropriate number of Pepsi Points, constituted the offer. There would be no enforceable contract until defendant accepted the Order Form and cashed the check.
The exception to the rule that advertisements do not create any power of acceptance in potential offerees is where the advertisement is “clear, definite, and explicit, and leaves nothing open for negotiation,” in that circumstance, “it constitutes an offer, acceptance of which will complete the contract.” Lefkowitz v Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, 251 Minn. 188, 86 N.W.2d 689, 691 (1957) In Lefkowitz, defendant had published a newspaper announcement stating: “Saturday 9 am Sharp, 3 Brand New Fur Coats, Worth to $100.00, First Come First Served $1 Each.” Mr. Morris Lefkowitz arrived at the store, dollar in hand, but was informed that under defendant’s “house rules,” the offer was open to ladies, but not gentlemen. The court ruled that because plaintiff had fulfilled all of the terms of the advertisement and the advertisement was specific and left nothing open for negotiation, a contract had been formed.
The present case is distinguishable from Lefkowitz. First, the commercial cannot be regarded in itself as sufficiently definite, because it specifically reserved the details of the offer to a separate writing, the Catalog. The commercial itself made no mention of the steps a potential offeree would be required to take to accept the alleged offer of a Harrier Jet. The advertisement in Lefkowitz, in contrast, “identified the person who could accept.” Second, even if the Catalog had included a Harrier Jet among the items that could be obtained by redemption of Pepsi Points, the advertisement of a Harrier Jet by both television commercial and catalog would still not constitute an offer.
The Court finds, in sum, that the Harrier Jet commercial was merely an advertisement.
[P]laintiff largely relies on a different species of unilateral offer, involving public offers of a reward for performance of a specified act. Because these cases generally involve public declarations regarding the efficacy or trustworthiness of specific products, one court has aptly characterized these authorities as “prove me wrong” cases. The most venerable of these precedents is the case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., 1 Q.B. 256 (Court of Appeal, 1892), a quote from which heads plaintiff’s memorandum of law: “[I]f a person chooses to make extravagant promises … he probably does so because it pays him to make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no reason in law why he should not be bound by them.”
The case arose during the London influenza epidemic of the 1890s. Among other advertisements of the time appeared solicitations for the Carbolic Smoke Ball. The specific advertisement that Mrs. Carlill saw, and relied upon, read as follows:
£100 reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic influenza, colds, or any diseases caused by taking cold, after having used the ball three times daily for two weeks according to the printed directions supplied with each ball. £1000 is deposited with the Alliance Bank, Regent Street, shewing our sincerity in the matter.
Mrs. Carlill purchased the smoke ball and used it as directed, but contracted influenza nevertheless. The advertisement was construed as offering a reward because it sought to induce performance, unlike an invitation to negotiate, which seeks a reciprocal promise. As Lord Justice Lindley explained, “advertisements offering rewards … are offers to anybody who performs the conditions named in the advertisement, and anybody who does perform the condition accepts the offer.” Because Mrs. Carlill had complied with the terms of the offer, yet contracted influenza, she was entitled to £100.
In the present case, the Harrier Jet commercial did not direct that anyone who appeared at Pepsi headquarters with 7,000,000 Pepsi Points on the Fourth of July would receive a Harrier Jet. Instead, the commercial urged consumers to accumulate Pepsi Points and to refer to the Catalog to determine how they could redeem their Pepsi Points. The commercial sought a reciprocal promise, expressed through acceptance of, and compliance with, the terms of the Order Form. As noted previously, the Catalog contains no mention of the Harrier Jet. Plaintiff states that he “noted that the Harrier Jet was not among the items described in the catalog, but this did not affect [his] understanding of the offer.”
In evaluating the commercial, the Court must not consider defendant’s subjective intent in making the commercial, or plaintiff’s subjective view of what the commercial offered, but what an objective, reasonable person would have understood the commercial to convey.
Plaintiff’s insistence that the commercial appears to be a serious offer requires the Court to explain why the commercial is funny. Explaining why a joke is funny is a daunting task; as the essayist E. B. White has remarked, “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process …” The commercial is the embodiment of what defendant appropriately characterizes as “zany humor.”
In light of the obvious absurdity of the commercial, the Court rejects plaintiff’s argument that the commercial was not clearly in jest.
For the reasons stated above, the Court grants defendant’s motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment granted and affirmed.
